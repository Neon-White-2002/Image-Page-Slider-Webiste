                        <p>Responsive web design is an approach that allows design across various devices (mobile, desktop, tablet, etc.) and suggests design should respond to the user’s behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation. <br> Flexible grids are foundational elements of responsive design. All assets such as images adapt to various screen sizes & resolutions (using CSS media queries). As a result, the user has great UX no matter what device they use—whether it’s a large desktop or small screen of mobile device, the website automatically switch to accommodate for resolution.</p>
